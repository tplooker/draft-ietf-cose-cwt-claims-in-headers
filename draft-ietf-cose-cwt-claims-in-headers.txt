              CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims in COSE Headers
              draft-ietf-cose-cwt-claims-in-headers-latest

Abstract

   This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in
   the header parameters of any COSE structure.  This functionality
   helps to facilitate applications that wish to make use of CBOR Web
   Token (CWT) claims in encrypted COSE structures and/or COSE
   structures featuring detached signatures, while having some of those
   claims be available before decryption and/or without inspecting the
   detached payload.

1.  Introduction

   In some applications of COSE, it is useful to have a standard
   representation of CWT claims [RFC8392] available in the header
   parameters.  These include encrypted COSE structures, which may or
   may not be an encrypted CWT and/or those featuring a detached
   signature.

   Section 5.3 of JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] defined a similar
   mechanism for expressing selected JWT based claims as JOSE header
   parameters.  This JWT feature was motivated by the desire to have
   certain claims, such as the Issuer value, be visible to software
   processing the JWT, even though the JWT is encrypted.  No
   corresponding feature was standardized for CWTs, which was an
   omission that this specification corrects.

   Directly including CWT claim values as COSE header parameter values
   would not work, since there are conflicts between the numeric header
   parameter assignments and the numeric CWT claim assignments.
   Instead, this specification defines a single header parameter
   registered in the IANA "COSE Header Parameters" registry that creates
   a location to store CWT claims in a COSE header parameter.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Representation

   This document defines the following COSE header parameter:

   +========+================+=======+=============+===================+
   | Name   | Label          | Value | Value       | Description       |
   |        |                | Type  | Registry    |                   |
   +========+================+=======+=============+===================+
   | CWT    | TBD (requested | map   | [IANA.COSE] | Location for      |
   | Claims | assignment 15) |       |             | CWT Claims in     |
   |        |                |       |             | COSE Header       |
   |        |                |       |             | Parameters        |
   +--------+----------------+-------+-------------+-------------------+

                                  Table 1

   The following is a non-normative description for the value type of
   the CWT claim header parameter using CDDL [RFC8610].

   CWT-Claims = {
    * Claim-Label => any
   }

   Claim-Label = int / text

   In cases where CWT claims are present both in the payload and the
   header of a CWT, an application receiving such a structure MUST
   verify that their values are identical, unless the application
   defines other specific processing rules for these claims.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the CWT Claims header parameter is used only
   in a protected header to avoid the contents being malleable.  The
   header parameter MUST only occur once in either the protected or
   unprotected header of a COSE structure.

   The CWT Claims header parameter MAY be used in any COSE object using
   header parameters, such as COSE_Sign objects.  Its use is not
   restricted to CWTs.

3.  Privacy Considerations

   Some of the registered CWT claims may contain privacy-sensitive
   information.  Since CWT claims in COSE headers are not encrypted,
   when privacy-sensitive information is present in these claims,
   applications and protocols using them should ensure that these COSE
   objects are only made visible to parties for which it is appropriate
   for them to have access to this sensitive information.

4.  Security Considerations

   Implementers should also review the security considerations for CWT,
   which are documented in Section 8 of [RFC8392].

   As described in [RFC9052], if the COSE payload is transported
   separately ("detached content"), then it is the responsibility of the
   application to ensure that it will be transported without changes.

   The reason for applications to verify that CWT claims that are
   present both in the payload and the header of a CWT are identical,
   unless it defines other specific processing rules for these claims,
   is to eliminate potential confusion that might arise by having
   different values for the same claim, which could result in
   inconsistent processing of such claims.

   Profiles define how to use CWT claims for particular applications,
   whether they are in the COSE payload or the CWT Claims header
   parameter, or both.  Therefore, understanding how to process the CWT
   Claims requires unambiguously knowing the profile being used.  A
   recommended way to include this information in the COSE structure is
   use of the typ (type) Header Parameter
   [I-D.ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter].  Other methods for determining
   the profile can also be used.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the new COSE header parameter "CWT
   Claims" in the table in Section 2 in the "COSE Header Parameters"
   registry [IANA.COSE].
